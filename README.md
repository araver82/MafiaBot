# MafiaBot

A Discord bot for hosting a game of Den Mafia!

**still under developement**  

* Den Mafia's home: http://mafiamaniac.net

## Features

**TODO list:**

* Fully scriptable linear-flow role system with [mixins](roles/mods) for super flexible yet simple role definitions.
* Add your own role setups using any combination of roles and mixins for any number of players.
* Configurable role setup variations which randomly change setups to get more fun and surprise out of your setups.
* Custom data store system that is IMPERVIOUS to corruption and crashes.
* Total control of user speech and group chat permissions to fully enforce no-talking-at-night and secret mafia chat rules.
* Keeps track of many in-game statistics such as a history of all votes made by every player.

## Install

* Node.js 8.0.0 or newer is required (because of current discord.js requirements)

```sh
$ npm install
```

* Add the bot to the Discord server (using https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot with the `CLIENT_ID_HERE` replaced by the actual token)
* Give the bot a role that allows him to overwrite permissions and create/delete channels (won't work on Admin role obviously).

## Config

* Setup all the admin user ID values in `config.js`  
* Setup the bot's user token in `creds.js` (follow the [Discord developer guide](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) to get the token)
* Change settings in `config.js` to have a mainChannel assigned to receive debug messages
** `defaultChannelId` id to use for debugging purposes
** `defaultChannelName` use this name as fallback to the id above
** `silentMode` set to false to enable debug messages to be sent to the mainChannel

## Run

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Debug

Install [Node Inspector](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector), then:
```sh
$ node-debug --nodejs mafia-debug.js
```
